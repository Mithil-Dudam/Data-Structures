# Data Structures in Python

This repository contains clean, efficient, and well-tested implementations of fundamental data structures in Python. Each data structure includes standard operations, edge case handling, and example usage/test cases.

## Contents

- **Trie** (`trie.py`): Prefix tree for fast string insert, search, delete, and prefix queries.
- **Max Heap** (`heap.py`): Array-based max heap with insert, extract, heapify, and peek operations.
- **Graph** (`graph.py`): Undirected graph using adjacency list with node/edge management, BFS, and DFS.
- **Stack** (`stack.py`): Linked list stack with push, pop, peek, size, and traversal.
- **Queue** (`queue.py`): Linked list queue with enqueue, dequeue, peek, size, and traversal.
- **Singly Linked List** (`singly_linked_list.py`): Insert, delete (by value/index), search, length, and traversal.
- **Doubly Linked List** (`doubly_linked_list.py`): Insert, delete (by value/index), search, length, and traversal.
- **Binary Search Tree** (`binary_search_tree.py`): Insert, delete, search, and in-order/pre-order/post-order traversals.
- **HashMap** (`hashmap.py`): Custom hash map with put, get, remove, contains, keys, values, items, and length methods. Handles collisions with separate chaining.

## Features

- All data structures are implemented from scratch in Python.
- Each file includes example usage and test cases.
- Edge cases are handled gracefully (e.g., empty structures, not found, out-of-range).
- Code is clean and readable

## Usage

Clone the repository and run any file directly to see example usage and outputs:

```bash
